#About The Project
There are plenty of great README templates on GitHub, but none of them quite fit what I was looking for, so I decided to create this improved version. My goal is to design a README template so exceptional that it'll be the only one you'll ever need â€” and I believe this is it.

Here's why:

Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜„
Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the BLANK_README.md to get started.
